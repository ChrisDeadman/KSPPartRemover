KSPPartRemover v1.0
=======================

Author: ChrisDeadman

Removes parts from Kerbal Space Program crafts

## Brief feature list
* Works with .craft and .sfs files
* Checks all links to the removed part(s) and also removes parts with "hard" dependencies
* Adapts "parent", "link", "sym", "SrfN" and "AttN" links on dependent parts - in other words performs a "safe" remove
* Can also print a list of crafts, parts or dependencies

## Usage
```
KSPPartRemover v1.0
Compatible with KSP version: 1.1.3

usage: KSPPartRemover.exe <command> [<switches>] -i <input-file>

Commands:

	 remove-parts
		 remove one or more parts from one or more crafts

	 list-crafts
		 list crafts in the input file

	 list-parts
		 list parts in the input file

	 list-partdeps
		 same as 'list-parts' but also prints dependencies
		 the part filter is applied on the dependencies for this command

Switches:

	 -i <path>
		 specifies the input file

	[Optional]
	 -o <path>
		 specifies the output file (modifies input file if not specified)

	[Optional]
	 -c, --craft <name-pattern>
		 apply craft filter (applies to all crafts if not specified)
		 '!' in front of the regex performs inverse matching
		 example for name pattern: --craft '^Asteroid'
		 example for inverse matching: --craft '!MÃ¼n'

	[Optional]
	 -p, --part <id or name-pattern>
		 apply part filter (applies to all parts if not specified)
		 if part is a number it is interpreted as the part id
		 '!' in front of the regex performs inverse matching
		 example for id: --part 1
		 example for name pattern: --part 'fuelTank.*'
		 example for inverse matching: --part '!^PotatoRoid$'

	[Optional]
	 -s, --silent
		 do not print additional info, do not ask for confirmation
```

## General notes

* If no output file is specified, the input file is modified.
* This tool supports a **--silent** switch and can be used programmatically should you desire.
* It has been tested with the following types of files so far :
  * .craft files generated by KSP 1.1
  * .sfs files generated by KSP 1.1
  * .txt craft files generated by the DarkMultiplayer Server (a pretty old version, quite a while ago)
