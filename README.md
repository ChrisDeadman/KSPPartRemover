KSPPartRemover v0.3
=======================
**(NO RELEASED YET, WORK IN PROGRESS)**

Author: ChrisDeadman

Removes parts from Kerbal Space Program crafts

## Brief feature list
* Works with .craft and .sfs files
* Checks all links to the removed part(s) and also removes parts with "hard" dependencies
* Adapts "parent", "link", "sym", "SrfN" and "AttN" links on dependent parts - in other words performs a "safe" remove
* Can also print a list of crafts, parts or dependencies

## Usage
```
KSPPartRemover v0.3.0.0
Compatible with KSP version: 1.1

usage: KSPPartRemover.exe <command> [<args>] -i <inputFilePath> [-o <outputFilePath>]

Commands:

	 remove-part
		 remove one or more parts from one or more crafts

	 list-crafts
		 list crafts in the input file

	 list-parts
		 list parts in the input file

	 list-partdeps
		 same as 'list-parts' but also prints dependencies
		 the part filter is applied on the dependencies for this command

Switches:

	 -i <FilePath>
		 specifies the input file

	[Optional]
	 -o <FilePath>
		 specifies the output file (prints to stdout if not specified)

	[Optional]
	 -c, --craft <craftNameRegex>
		 apply craft filter (applies to all crafts if not specified)

	[Optional]
	 -p, --part <partId or partNameRegex>
		 apply part filter (applies to all parts if not specified)

	[Optional]
	 -s, --silent
		 do not print additional info, do not ask for confirmation
```

## General notes

If no output file is specified, StdOut is used.
That way, if used in combination with --silent, it can be used programmatically should you desire.

This tool has been tested with the following types of files so far :
* .craft files generated by KSP 1.1
* .sfs files generated by KSP 1.1
* .txt craft files generated by the DarkMultiplayer Server (a pretty old version, quite a while ago)
