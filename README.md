KSPPartRemover v0.2
======================
Author: ChrisDeadman

Removes parts from Kerbal Space Program crafts

#### Brief feature list:
* Checks all references to the removed part and removes all affected parts
* Lists the parts to remove before the actual removal (if not used with the --silent switch)
* Adapts all the "parent", "sym", "SrfN" and "AttN" entries
* In other words performs a "safe" remove ;-)
* At the moment only works with files which only include one single craft
* (which means you need to copy your craft to a temporary file in case you want to modify .sfs files)

#### Usage:
```
usage: KSPPartRemover.exe COMMAND [-s | --silent] -i <inputFilePath> [-o <outputFilePath>]

Commands:

	-r, --remove <nameOrIdOfPartToRemove>
			remove all parts with the given name - or id if the parameter is an integer

	-l, --list
			list all parts in craft file

Arguments:

	-i <filePath>
			specifies the input file (Mandatory)
			
	-o <filePath>
			specifies the output file (Optional, prints to stdout if not specified)
			
	-s, --silent
			do not print additional information and do not ask for removal confirmation
```

#### General notes:

If no output file is specified, StdOut is used.
That way, if used in combination with --silent, it can be used programmatically should you desire.

Refer to the unit tests for further "documentation" ;-)

Note also that this has only been tested with the following types of files so far :
* .txt craft files generated by the DarkMultiplayer Server
* .craft files generated by KSP

#### Notes on .sfs files
This initial version of the remover only supports files which just contain one single craft.

If you want to use it to modify your persistent.sfs or quicksave.sfs files, create a temporary file containing only the craft
you want to modify and then insert the modified result back into your .sfs file.
