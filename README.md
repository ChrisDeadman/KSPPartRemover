KSPPartRemover v0.1
======================
Author: ChrisDeadman

Removes parts from Kerbal Space Program crafts

* Checks all references to the removed part and removes all affected parts
* Lists the parts to remove before the actual removal (if not used with the --silent switch)
* Adapts all the "parent", "sym", "SrfN" and "AttN" entries
* In other words performs a "safe" remove ;-)

usage: KSPPartRemover.exe -p | --part-name "nameOfPartToRemove" [-s | --silent] -i "inputFile" [-o "outputFile"]

If no output file is specified, StdOut is used.
That way, if used in combination with --silent, it can be used programmatically should you desire.

Refer to the unit tests for further "documentation" ;-)

IMPORTANT NOTE:
================
This initial version of the remover only supports files that contain only one single craft!!!
(e.g. the .txt craft files generated by the DarkMultiplayer Server)

If you want to use it to modify your persistent.sfs or quicksave.sfs files, create a temporary file containing only the craft
you want to modify and then insert the modified result back into your .sfs file.

Note also that this has only been tested with .txt craft files generated by the DarkMultiplayer Server so far.
