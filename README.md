KSPPartRemover v1.2.1
=====================

Author: ChrisDeadman

Removes parts from Kerbal Space Program crafts - and more :)

## Brief feature list
* Works with craft (.craft) and savegame (.sfs) files
* Can print the list of crafts in a savegame-file
* Can print the list of parts in any craft- or savegame-file
* Can print the list of part-dependencies in any craft- or savegame-file
* Can print mods used by any craft- or savegame-file
* Can remove parts from any craft- or savegame-file
  * Checks all links to the removed part(s) and only removes dependent parts with "hard" dependencies
  * Adapts "parent", "link", "sym", "SrfN" and "AttN" links on dependent parts

## General notes

* If no output file is specified, the input file is modified.
* This tool supports a **--silent** switch and can be used programmatically should you desire.
* It has been tested with the following types of files so far :
  * .craft files generated by KSP 1.12
  * .sfs files generated by KSP 1.12
  * .txt vessel files generated by LMPServer (not fully tested)

## Usage
```
KSPPartRemover v1.2.1
Compatible with KSP version: 1.12.3

usage: KSPPartRemover <command> [<switches>] -i <input-file>

Commands:

         list-crafts
                 list crafts in the input file

         list-parts
                 list parts in the input file

         list-partdeps
                 same as 'list-parts' but also prints dependencies
                 the part filter is applied on the dependencies for this command

         list-mods
                 list mods used by the parts in the input file
                 if you don't have a required mod installed it will be listed as UNKNOWN
                 [KSP directory needs to be your current directory for this to work!]

         remove-parts
                 remove one or more parts from one or more crafts

Switches:

         -i <path>
                 specifies the input file

        [Optional]
         -o <path>
                 specifies the output file (modifies input file if not specified)

        [Optional]
         -c, --craft <name-pattern>
                 apply craft filter (applies to all crafts if not specified)
                 '!' in front of the regex performs inverse matching
                 example for name pattern: --craft '^Asteroid'
                 example for inverse matching: --craft '!MÃ¼n'

        [Optional]
         -p, --part <id or name-pattern>
                 apply part filter (applies to all parts if not specified)
                 if part is a number it is interpreted as the part id
                 '!' in front of the regex performs inverse matching
                 example for id: --part 1
                 example for name pattern: --part 'fuelTank.*'
                 example for inverse matching: --part '!^PotatoRoid$'

        [Optional]
         -s, --silent
                 do not print additional info, do not ask for confirmation
```
